Tasks 4-5: Empty State Logic & Profile Onboarding
Your new user flow is perfectly designed! Now let's tackle the next critical piece - what happens when they click "Create Your First Plan."
Based on your PRD, this triggers the profile/onboarding flow. Let me ask specific questions about Task 5: Pre-meal plan onboarding:
Profile Setup Trigger & Flow:
When Profile Setup Happens: You mentioned "if no profile exists, show pop-up/onboarding screen." Should this be:
Immediate modal when they click "Create Plan"?
Separate page they're redirected to?
Slide-in panel over the main page?
Individual vs Family Choice: This seems like the most important decision. How should you present this?
Two big cards: "Plan for Myself" vs "Plan for My Family"?
Simple toggle switch?
Radio buttons with explanations?
Family Profile Specifics:
Adding Family Members: For the family option, what's the UX?
Modal with "Add Family Member" button?
Pre-set slots (Parent 1, Parent 2, Child 1, etc.)?
Flexible list where they add as many as needed?
Family Member Info: What do you need to collect for each person?
Name + Age (for nutrition calculations)?
Dietary restrictions per person?
Avatars/characters for gamification?
Goals Setting: You mentioned shared vs individual goals. How complex should this be?
Simple checkboxes: "Save money," "Eat healthier," "Reduce stress"?
More specific: "Save $X per month," "Eat vegetables X times per week"?
Free text input?
Profile Completion & Transition:
Onboarding Length: How many steps/screens should this be?
Single screen with all info?
Multi-step wizard (Individual/Family → Family Members → Goals → Summary)?
Progressive disclosure (start simple, add details later)?
Skip vs Required: Can users skip profile setup and go straight to meal planning?
Skip button with "Complete later" option?
Required for meal generation to work properly?
Partial skip (just need Individual/Family choice)?
Post-Profile Flow: After profile completion, where do they go?
Straight to AI meal planner?
Back to main page with profile complete?
Confirmation screen first?
Cultural/Personal Touch:
Avatar/Character Selection: You mentioned choosing avatars. What style?
Diverse family representations?
Fun cartoon characters?
Simple color/icon combinations?
Motivational Messaging: What tone for the profile setup?
"Let's get to know your family so we can plan the perfect meals"?
"Tell us about yourself so we can save you the most money"?
More casual/conversational?
Which aspect should we dive into first? The Individual vs Family choice presentation, the family member setup flow, or the goals/preferences collection?
