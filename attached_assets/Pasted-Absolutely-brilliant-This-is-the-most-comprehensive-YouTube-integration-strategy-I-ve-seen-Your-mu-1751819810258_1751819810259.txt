## **Task 11: Ingredient & Instruction Extraction Engine**

Now for the most technically challenging part - extracting usable meal planning data from YouTube videos. This is what makes your app truly unique and valuable.

### **Extraction Source Priority & Strategy:**

1. **Three-Source Hierarchy:** You mentioned description → hearted comments → transcript. Should this be:
   - **Sequential fallback** (try description, if fails try comments, if fails try transcript)?
   - **Parallel extraction** (extract from all three, merge/validate results)?
   - **Confidence-weighted** (extract from all, use highest confidence result)?

2. **Video Description Parsing:** What patterns should you look for?
   - **Structured sections** ("INGREDIENTS:", "DIRECTIONS:", "RECIPE:")?
   - **Common formats** (numbered lists, bullet points, paragraph text)?
   - **Measurement detection** ("2 cups flour", "1 lb chicken", "3 tbsp olive oil")?

3. **Hearted Comments Strategy:** How do you identify recipe comments vs regular comments?
   - **Creator heart/pin indicators** (YouTube API provides this)?
   - **Keyword detection** (comments containing "recipe", "ingredients")?
   - **Format recognition** (structured lists in comments)?

### **Natural Language Processing & Pattern Recognition:**

4. **Ingredient Parsing Complexity:** How sophisticated should ingredient extraction be?
   - **Simple regex patterns** ("2 cups flour", "1 large onion")?
   - **NLP libraries** (spaCy, NLTK for advanced parsing)?
   - **AI/LLM integration** (GPT for complex ingredient lists)?

5. **Measurement Standardization:** How do you handle measurement variations?
   - **Unit conversion** ("1 lb" → "16 oz", "1 cup" → "240ml")?
   - **Quantity parsing** ("a couple of tomatoes" → "2 tomatoes")?
   - **Ambiguous measurements** ("salt to taste", "handful of spinach")?

6. **Instruction Extraction:** What constitutes usable cooking instructions?
   - **Step numbering** (automatic numbering of sentences)?
   - **Action verb detection** ("heat", "mix", "bake", "season")?
   - **Time/temperature extraction** ("bake for 20 minutes at 350°F")?

### **Video Transcript Analysis:**

7. **Transcript Availability:** How do you handle transcript limitations?
   - **Auto-generated vs manual** captions (quality differences)?
   - **Timestamp correlation** (link ingredients mentioned to video time)?
   - **Language/accent challenges** (auto-captions often miss food terms)?

8. **Transcript Pattern Recognition:** What verbal cues indicate recipe information?
   - **Ingredient mentions** ("we're going to need two cups of flour")?
   - **Instruction phrases** ("first, we'll heat the oil", "next step is to add")?
   - **Timing cues** ("cook this for about five minutes")?

### **Data Quality & Confidence Scoring:**

9. **Extraction Confidence:** How do you measure extraction quality?
   - **Source reliability scoring** (description > pinned comment > transcript)?
   - **Format consistency** (structured lists score higher than paragraphs)?
   - **Completeness checking** (both ingredients AND instructions found)?

10. **Quality Validation:** How do you verify extracted data makes sense?
    - **Ingredient reasonableness** (realistic quantities, known food items)?
    - **Instruction logic** (cooking steps in logical order)?
    - **Cross-source validation** (same ingredients mentioned in multiple sources)?

### **Integration with Existing Meal Planning:**

11. **Portion Scaling:** How do you adapt YouTube recipes to family sizes?
    - **Original serving detection** ("serves 4", "feeds a family of 6")?
    - **Automatic scaling** based on family member count?
    - **Scaling confidence** (some ingredients don't scale linearly)?

12. **Nutrition Integration:** How do YouTube recipes fit your nutrition system?
    - **Ingredient-to-nutrition mapping** using your existing USDA database?
    - **Estimated vs calculated** nutrition (lower confidence for YouTube recipes)?
    - **Missing ingredient handling** (what if extraction misses key ingredients)?

### **Error Handling & Fallbacks:**

13. **Extraction Failure Scenarios:** What happens when extraction completely fails?
    - **Manual entry prompt** ("We couldn't extract ingredients - add them yourself")?
    - **Partial extraction** (show what was found, let user complete)?
    - **Alternative suggestions** (similar AI-generated meals as backup)?

14. **User Correction System:** How do users fix extraction errors?
    - **Inline editing** of extracted ingredients/instructions?
    - **Feedback system** to improve extraction for future users?
    - **Save corrected versions** for other users of the same video?

### **Technical Implementation:**

15. **Real-time vs Batch Processing:** When should extraction happen?
    - **On-demand** when user clicks "Add to Plan"?
    - **Pre-processing** popular videos in background?
    - **Caching strategy** for frequently requested videos?

16. **Performance & Scalability:** How do you handle extraction efficiently?
    - **Extraction time limits** (max 10 seconds per video)?
    - **Queue system** for complex extractions?
    - **Fallback to simpler methods** if advanced parsing times out?

**Which aspect of the ingredient extraction engine should we focus on first? The multi-source extraction strategy, the NLP pattern recognition, or the quality validation and confidence scoring system?**
