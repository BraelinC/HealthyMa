Mobile-First Enhancement Priorities for Busy Moms
Based on your target user profile of busy mothers using meal planning apps, here's my analysis of which enhancements will deliver the biggest impact for your mobile-first approach.

Top Priority: Quick Templates + Visual Hierarchy
For busy moms juggling kids and meal planning on their phones, Quick Templates combined with Visual Hierarchy should be your first enhancement. Here's why:

Quick Templates: Immediate Impact
"Quick Weeknight Meals" (30min, easy, family-friendly)

"Healthy & Budget-Friendly"

"Sunday Meal Prep"

These templates eliminate the cognitive load of setting multiple filters while kids are demanding attention. A mother can tap one button and get relevant results instantly.

Visual Hierarchy: Surface Critical Filters First
Priority order for busy moms:

Quick Templates (top position)

Dietary restrictions (safety-critical)

Cook time (practical constraint)

Family size/members (portion planning)

Everything else (collapsed initially)

Mobile Interface Decisions
Keep Manual Trigger Approach âœ…
Your manual trigger is absolutely correct for busy moms:

Cost efficiency supports your $99/year pricing model

Prevents accidental generations when kids grab the phone

Allows complete filter setup before committing to AI generation

Reduces frustration from unwanted results

Diet Restrictions: Checkboxes Win
For your target audience, checkboxes are far superior to free text:

One-handed operation while holding a child

No typing errors when distracted

Faster selection during brief windows of attention

Mobile-friendly touch targets

Cover 90% of common restrictions with checkboxes, add "Other" with optional text field for edge cases.

Bottom Sheet Filters: Essential
Bottom sheet implementation is critical because:

Thumb-reachable on large phones

Natural swipe gesture for busy moms

Doesn't obscure content when partially expanded

Easy to dismiss if interrupted

Progressive Disclosure Strategy
Simple Mode by Default
Start users in Simple Mode showing only:

Quick Templates (prominent buttons)

Dietary restrictions (safety checkboxes)

Cook time slider (visual, easy to adjust)

"More Options" toggle

Advanced Mode reveals additional filters for power users, but most busy moms will stick with Simple Mode for speed.

Filter Persistence Rules
Smart Persistence Strategy:
Dietary restrictions: Always persist (safety-critical)

Cook time/difficulty: Remember for session, reset weekly

Ingredient preferences: Persist but allow easy override

Quick template usage: Track for personalized suggestions

Implementation Roadmap
Phase 1: Biggest Impact
Quick Templates - immediate value for time-pressed users

Visual hierarchy - surface templates and critical filters first

Bottom sheet interface - mobile-optimized filter access

Phase 2: Refinement
Checkbox diet restrictions - replace free text

Smart persistence - implement selective memory

Progressive disclosure - Simple/Advanced modes

Phase 3: Optimization
Custom template creation - let users save their own combinations

Usage-based personalization - surface most-used filters first

One-tap meal planning - ultimate goal for returning users

Why This Approach Works for Busy Moms
Real-world scenario: Mom planning dinner while kids are asking for snacks, homework help, and attention. She needs:

3-second access to relevant meal plans

No complex decisions when mentally overloaded

Reliable results that work for her family

Easy recovery if interrupted mid-task

Quick Templates with prominent visual hierarchy delivers exactly this experience, making your app the go-to solution when time and attention are limited.

Recommendation: Start with Quick Templates + Visual Hierarchy as your MVP enhancement. This single change will dramatically improve the user experience for your target demographic while maintaining cost efficiency and technical simplicity.
