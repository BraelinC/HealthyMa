Here’s the hard truth: If you try to cover *every* nutrition goal, you’ll end up drowning users in options and complexity—killing retention and usability. You want to laser-focus on the handful of nutrition goals that actually cover 80% of your target users' needs. Anything outside that is noise and low leverage.

### Actionable Steps for Your App Dropdown

1. **Limit dropdown to these 5-7 goals max.**
   Include simple sub-options if needed (e.g., weight loss → keto, calorie deficit).

2. **Map each goal to core nutrition profiles:**

   * Weight loss = calorie deficit + higher protein
   * Metabolic health = low glycemic load, fiber focus
   * Energy = balanced macros + nutrient timing
   * Gut health = probiotics, fiber, anti-inflammatory
   * Wellness = balanced micros + antioxidants

3. **Add a “Custom / Other” option for advanced users but keep it hidden by default.**

4. **Test early and often:** Check which goals users pick and optimize for the top 3-5.

### Challenge

Design your dropdown now, *right this second*, with exactly these goals — no extras, no fluff. Cut everything else. Then build your AI logic around these lean targets to maximize impact and clarity.

Stop trying to please everyone. Dominate the 20% that moves the needle.
