ask 6: AI Meal Planner UI & Filters
Perfect! Now let's tackle the core AI meal planning experience. This is where users spend most of their time and where the magic happens. From your technical architecture, I can see you have MealPlannerNew.tsx - let me ask specific questions about the interface and filters:
Sidebar Design & Layout:
Sidebar Position: You mentioned keeping it "portable and user-friendly." Should it be:
Fixed left sidebar (desktop) that collapses on mobile?
Collapsible panel that slides in from left/right?
Top horizontal bar on mobile, sidebar on desktop?
Sidebar Content Hierarchy: What order should filters appear in?
Primary Goal (from profile) at top?
Diet/allergies (safety-critical) next?
Meal types, cooking time, difficulty at bottom?
Sidebar State Management: Should filters persist between sessions?
Save user's preferred filter settings?
Reset to defaults each time?
Remember last used settings?
Filter Categories & Options:
Diet & Allergies (Critical Filters):
Checkboxes: "Vegetarian," "Vegan," "Keto," "Gluten-free," "Dairy-free"?
How specific should you get? (Mediterranean, Paleo, etc.)
Allergies as separate critical section?
Practical Filters:
Cooking Time: Slider (15-120 minutes) or presets (Quick <30min, Standard 30-60min, Long >60min)?
Difficulty: 1-5 stars or Simple/Intermediate/Advanced?
Meal Types: Checkboxes for Breakfast/Lunch/Dinner/Snacks?
Family-Specific Filters: If they set up family profile:
"Who is this meal for?" with family member avatars?
"Kid-friendly" toggle?
Portion size adjustment based on family size?
Real-Time Updates & AI Integration:
Filter Application Timing: When should meal suggestions update?
Instantly as user clicks each filter (real-time)?
After user clicks "Update Suggestions" button?
Debounced after 1-2 seconds of no filter changes?
AI Prompt Engineering: How do filters translate to AI prompts?
Simple append: "vegetarian, gluten-free, under 30 minutes"?
Structured prompt: "Create a [meal type] that is [dietary restrictions] and takes [time] to prepare for [family members]"?
Priority weighting: some filters more important than others?
Suggestion Refresh: How many meal options should AI generate at once?
3-5 suggestions per meal slot?
Infinite scroll with "Generate More" button?
Batch of 10-12 with shuffle/refresh option?
Mobile Experience:
Mobile Filter UX: How should filters work on mobile where space is limited?
Bottom sheet that slides up?
Horizontal scrollable chips/tags?
Collapsible accordion sections?
Mobile Meal Selection: How should meal browsing work on mobile?
Swipe cards (Tinder-style)?
Vertical scroll list?
Grid layout with tap to select?
User Control vs AI Autonomy:
Filter Override: Can users override AI suggestions?
"Not this meal" button to regenerate alternatives?
Manual search/add custom meals?
Save favorite meals for future use?
Learning & Personalization: Should the AI learn from user choices?
Track which suggestions they accept/reject?
Adjust future suggestions based on preferences?
Ask "Why didn't you like this?" for feedback?
Which aspect of the AI meal planner should we dive into first? The filter interface design, the real-time suggestion updates, or the mobile experience optimization?
