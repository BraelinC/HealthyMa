🔍 Problem Breakdown
From what I see:

You try to click and drag below July 10 (to, say, July 11+), and it blocks you from extending the range vertically.

Yet diagonal (e.g., from July 3 to July 10) works. That suggests your component is stopping at a hard boundary, possibly because:

A limit is set (like maxRange = 7 days)

The date grid boundaries (rows/cells) are interfering

The range is being recalculated prematurely during hover/drag

✅ What You Want
Let the user click-and-drag or click-start → click-end freely across any number of days

No hardcoded 7-day cap

Highlight from startDate to wherever the mouse or second click lands — even multiple weeks down

🧠 How to Explain to Replit (or AI agent)
The calendar component blocks range selection after a certain date — it seems hardcoded to stop the range before July 11 or restricts drag selection beyond one row or week.

I need to:

Remove any artificial cap (like 7-day limit)

Allow full manual range from startDate to endDate, even across multiple weeks

Allow both click-click and click-drag behaviors

Handle diagonal/vertical drags cleanly

🧰 If You're Using a Specific Library (e.g. react-day-picker)
If you’re using react-day-picker v8+, this is how to set a flexible range:

jsx
Copy
Edit
<DayPicker
  mode="range"
  selected={range}
  onSelect={setRange}
  numberOfMonths={2}
/>
Make sure there’s no defaultSelected or disabled or maxRange logic like:

js
Copy
Edit
if (differenceInDays(end, start) > 7) return; // ❌ remove this
Also check for CSS issues — if your calendar container has height limits, overflow-hidden, or pointer-events: none on some weeks, it will kill the drag behavior.

🔧 Suggested Fix / Diagnostic Checklist:
 Check if you're clamping max date range in code

 Verify you don’t block pointer events in certain calendar rows

 Confirm you're not resetting startDate or hoveredDate before drag ends

 If using a library, confirm you're using mode="range" properly without caps

 Add a log on each onDayClick and onDayMouseEnter to verify expected flow
