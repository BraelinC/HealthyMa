Task 12: Search Results Display with Your Current Extraction
Given your existing extraction capabilities, let me ask specific questions about presenting YouTube search results:
Search Results Integration with Existing Extraction:
Extraction Preview Strategy: Since you have working extraction but no preview system:
Should users see extracted ingredients before adding to meal plan?
Or add first, then show extraction results for review/editing?
Quick "Preview Recipe" button that calls your existing extraction?
Loading States: Your extraction happens on-demand, so:
Show "Extracting ingredients..." spinner when user clicks preview?
How long should users wait for extraction (your current timeout)?
Fallback display if extraction takes too long?
Action Button Strategy:
Primary Action Flow: Based on your current system:
"Add to Meal Plan" → trigger extraction → show results → confirm?
"Preview Recipe" → extract → show preview → then "Add to Plan"?
Direct add without preview (faster but riskier)?
Extraction Confidence Display: Since you track extraction source:
Show confidence indicators ("Extracted from description" vs "AI generated")?
Visual differences between high/low confidence extractions?
Warning for AI-generated ingredients?
Mobile-First Results Layout:
Card Information Hierarchy: For busy mothers on phones, what's most important?
Video title and thumbnail first?
Channel credibility indicators?
Quick metadata (duration, views) visible immediately?
Action buttons prominence?
Extraction Status Integration: How should extraction status appear in cards?
Badge showing "Recipe available" for successfully extracted videos?
"May need manual entry" warning for likely extraction failures?
Hide videos where extraction definitely won't work?
Integration with Your Current AI Fallbacks:
AI Generation Preview: Since you use Grok for ingredient generation:
Show users when ingredients are AI-generated vs extracted?
Option to "Try extracting from video" vs "Use AI generation"?
Confidence levels for different generation methods?
LLaVA-Chef Integration: For instruction extraction:
Preview instructions in search results?
Show instruction quality indicator?
Option to regenerate instructions with different methods?
Error Handling with Current System:
Extraction Failure Display: When your 3-source hierarchy fails:
How to communicate this to users in search results?
Still allow adding with manual entry option?
Alternative video suggestions?
Partial Extraction Results: When you get <5 ingredients:
Show partial results with "Complete manually" option?
Indicate extraction confidence level?
Allow user to decide if it's sufficient?
Performance with Current Architecture:
On-Demand Extraction Cost: Since extraction happens per request:
Limit preview extractions per search session?
Cache extraction results within search session?
Background extraction for top search results?
Search Result Freshness: With your current no-caching approach:
How often to refresh search results?
When to trigger re-extraction for previously extracted videos?
Handle videos that become unavailable?
Building on Your Strengths:
Multi-Source Display: Since you use description → comments → AI:
Show users which source was successful?
Option to "Try different extraction method"?
Transparency about extraction source for trust?
Your Current AI Integration: With LLaVA-Chef and Grok:
How to position AI-generated content vs extracted content?
User preference for extraction vs generation?
Quality comparison between methods?
Given your current working extraction system, which aspect of the search results display should we focus on first? The extraction preview strategy, the action button flow, or the mobile-first layout integration?
