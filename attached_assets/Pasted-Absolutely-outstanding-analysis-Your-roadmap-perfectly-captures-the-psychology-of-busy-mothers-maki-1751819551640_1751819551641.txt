## **Tasks 10-14: YouTube Integration & Recipe Search Features**

Now we're entering the most innovative part of your app - the YouTube recipe integration that makes NutriMa truly unique. This is where you differentiate from every other meal planning app.

Let me start with **Task 10: YouTube API Integration** and ask strategic questions about implementation:

### **YouTube API Strategy & Search:**

1. **Search Trigger Points:** When/where should users be able to search for recipes?
   - **During meal plan generation** (replace AI suggestions with YouTube finds)?
   - **After plan creation** (add custom recipes to existing plan)?
   - **Separate recipe discovery** mode for browsing?

2. **Search Query Intelligence:** How should you construct YouTube search queries?
   - **User types:** "chicken pasta" → Search "chicken pasta recipe"?
   - **AI-enhanced:** Use meal plan context → "quick chicken pasta recipe under 30 minutes"?
   - **Filter integration:** Apply diet restrictions → "gluten-free chicken pasta recipe"?

3. **Content Curation:** YouTube has millions of videos - how do you find good recipes?
   - **Channel whitelist** (trusted food creators only)?
   - **Video length filtering** (5-20 minutes for actual recipes)?
   - **View count thresholds** (popular recipes more likely to be good)?
   - **Upload date filtering** (recent recipes vs. classic ones)?

### **Video Quality & Safety:**

4. **Content Filtering:** How do you avoid non-recipe content?
   - **Title keyword filtering** ("recipe," "how to make," "cooking")?
   - **Description scanning** for ingredient lists?
   - **Duration limits** (too short = not detailed, too long = not focused)?

5. **Family-Safe Content:** For your target audience (mothers with families):
   - **YouTube API content rating** checks?
   - **Manual review process** for frequently selected videos?
   - **User reporting system** for inappropriate content?

### **Technical Implementation:**

6. **API Usage & Costs:** YouTube API has quotas and costs:
   - **Search optimization:** Cache popular searches?
   - **Quota management:** Limit searches per user per day?
   - **Fallback strategy:** What happens when quota is exceeded?

7. **Video Player Integration:** For in-app playback:
   - **YouTube embedded player** (requires YouTube branding)?
   - **Custom video player** (more complex, better UX)?
   - **Mobile vs desktop** player differences?

### **User Experience Flow:**

8. **Search Result Presentation:** How should recipe videos be displayed?
   - **Grid layout** with thumbnails and titles?
   - **List view** with metadata (duration, views, channel)?
   - **Carousel/swipe** interface for browsing?

9. **Video Interaction:** What can users do with found recipes?
   - **Watch in-app** while planning meals?
   - **Extract and save** ingredients without watching?
   - **Add to meal plan** directly from search results?
   - **Save favorites** for future use?

### **Integration with Meal Planning:**

10. **Meal Plan Replacement:** If users find a YouTube recipe they prefer:
    - **Replace AI-generated meal** with YouTube recipe?
    - **Merge YouTube ingredients** with existing meal plan?
    - **Adjust portion calculations** based on video recipe?

11. **Ingredient Extraction Preview:** Before adding to meal plan:
    - **Show extracted ingredients** for user review?
    - **Allow manual editing** of extracted data?
    - **Confidence scoring** ("We're 90% confident about these ingredients")?

### **Mobile-First Considerations:**

12. **Mobile Search UX:** For busy mothers on phones:
    - **Voice search** ("Find me a quick chicken recipe")?
    - **Auto-complete** based on current meal plan context?
    - **Quick filters** (under 30min, one-pot, kid-friendly)?

13. **Mobile Video Playback:** Watching recipes while cooking:
    - **Picture-in-picture** mode?
    - **Audio-only** option for hands-free cooking?
    - **Step-by-step** text extraction for following along?

**Which aspect of the YouTube integration should we focus on first? The search strategy and content curation, the technical API implementation, or the user experience flow for finding and using recipes?**
