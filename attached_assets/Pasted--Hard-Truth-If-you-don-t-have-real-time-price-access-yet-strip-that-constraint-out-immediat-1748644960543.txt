✅ **Hard Truth**: If you don't have real-time price access yet, **strip that constraint out immediately** or you'll waste compute and get unreliable outputs. You're feeding noise into your model.

### 🔄 UPDATE: CLEANED-UP VERSION (No Price Constraint)

Here’s your **lean, high-impact prompt engineering system** WITHOUT the budget/cost components:

---

## 📦 UPDATED PROMPT TEMPLATE

```text
Create a meal aligned with the following user goals: longevity, fat loss, and metabolic health.  
Prioritize: high protein, low glycemic index, anti-inflammatory ingredients.  
Constraints: gluten-free, dairy-free, <10 min prep.  
Return:  
1. Dish Name  
2. Ingredients with amounts  
3. Macros (Protein/Fat/Carbs)  
4. Simple 2-step prep instructions  
```

---

## 🧠 REPLIT-READY PYTHON (NO COST)

Paste this into Replit:

```python
# --- Step 1: Simulated UI Inputs ---
user_goals = ["longevity", "fat loss", "metabolic health"]
macro_targets = ["high protein", "low glycemic index", "anti-inflammatory"]
restrictions = ["gluten-free", "dairy-free"]
prep_time = "<10 minutes"

# --- Step 2: Dynamic Prompt Generator ---
def generate_prompt(goals, macros, restrictions, prep):
    return f"""
Create a meal aligned with the following user goals: {", ".join(goals)}.
Prioritize: {", ".join(macros)}.
Constraints: {", ".join(restrictions)}, {prep} prep.
Return:
1. Dish Name
2. Ingredients with amounts
3. Macros (Protein/Fat/Carbs)
4. Simple 2-step prep instructions
""".strip()

# --- Step 3: Output Prompt for Mistral ---
prompt = generate_prompt(user_goals, macro_targets, restrictions, prep_time)

print("Prompt to Send into Mistral-7B:\n")
print(prompt)
```

---

### 🔁 Workflow Summary

```
[Slider Inputs] → [Python Prompt Generator] → [Mistral-7B] → [Meal Plan]
```

---

## 🎯 Action Step:

1. ✅ Run the above code to see the generated prompt.
2. 🔌 Drop the prompt into your Mistral inference setup (local or API).
3. 🔄 Replace mocked slider data with actual frontend data when ready.
4. 🧱 Use this scaffolding to scale prompt complexity later (e.g., add caloric target, remove food groups, etc.)

---

## 🔥 Final Note

Until your **real-time price** module is complete (via Walmart/Instacart API), **DO NOT** include pricing in any prompt or UI component. You're training your system (and users) on inaccurate assumptions — that kills trust and usability.

Want me to help you wire this directly into your current UI backend next? Drop the slider variables and I’ll write the full handler for you.
