Profile Tab Structure
1. Basic Profile Info
Name (e.g., “Smith Family” or “Jessica”)
Email (optional)
Primary goal (e.g., Save Money, Eat Healthier, Gain Muscle, Family Wellness)
Number of people in the family (for serving size calculations)
2. Family Members (Optional, Expandable)
List of family members (e.g., Mom, Dad, Child 1, Child 2)
For each member (optional, not required):
Name or nickname
Age (or age group: child, teen, adult)
Dietary preferences (vegetarian, allergies, dislikes, etc.)
Individual goals (optional: e.g., “Dad wants to gain muscle,” “Child 1 is picky eater”)
3. Customization Philosophy
Only the main profile and family size are required.
Adding details for each family member is optional—users can skip or fill in as much as they want.
The more info they provide, the more personalized the plans.
How to Implement (UI/UX Guidance)
Step 1: Show a simple form for main profile and family size.
Step 2: Ask if they want to add details for individual family members (with a “Skip” option).
Step 3: For each member, show a small form (name, age, preferences, goals), but make all fields optional.
Step 4: Save all info in the user’s profile for use in prompt generation and serving size calculations.
Example Data Structure (JavaScript/JSON)
json
Copy Code
{
  "profileName": "Smith Family",
  "primaryGoal": "Family Wellness",
  "familySize": 4,
  "members": [
    {
      "name": "Jessica",
      "ageGroup": "Adult",
      "preferences": ["vegetarian"],
      "goals": ["lose weight"]
    },
    {
      "name": "Mike",
      "ageGroup": "Adult",
      "preferences": [],
      "goals": ["gain muscle"]
    },
    {
      "name": "Ella",
      "ageGroup": "Child",
      "preferences": ["no nuts"],
      "goals": []
    }
  ]
}
If the user skips member details, just store the main profile and family size.
