## üß™ How to Test

### **Test 1: Basic Research Functionality**
1. Navigate to Profile page
2. Add some cultural cuisines (e.g., "Italian", "Mexican", "Japanese")
3. Look for the small external link icon next to each cuisine badge
4. **Open browser DevTools (F12) and go to Console tab to see debug logs**
5. Click the research button for a cuisine
6. Should see:
   - Loading spinner on the button
   - Console logs showing the API request process
   - Research results appearing below
   - Detailed cuisine information loaded from Perplexity

### **Debug Information**
If you see "Research Failed", check the browser console for detailed error messages:
- `üîç Starting research for cuisine: [Name]` - Request initiated
- `üì° Response status: [Code] [Status]` - Server response
- `‚úÖ Research data received` - Success
- `‚ùå Server error` or `‚ùå Error researching cuisine` - Failure with details

The API endpoint is working correctly (verified with direct testing), so any failures should show specific error details in the console.

### **Test 2: Research Results Display**
1. After clicking research button, verify the display shows:
   - **Cuisine Details Card** with proper styling
   - **Authentic Dishes** section with:
     - Dish names and descriptions

     - Healthy modification suggestions
   - **Information Grid** with:
     - Key ingredients
     - Cooking techniques  
     - Cooking styles
     - Health benefits

### **Test 3: Multiple Cuisine Research**
1. Research different cuisines sequentially
2. Use "Show Research" / "Hide Research" toggle
3. Verify research data persists after toggling
4. Test multiple cuisines to ensure data doesn't conflict

### **Test 4: Error Handling**
1. Test with invalid cuisine name (if possible)
2. Test rate limiting (multiple rapid requests)
3. Verify proper error messages in toast notifications
