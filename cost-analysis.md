# RecipeAI Cost & Scalability Analysis

## Current API Usage & Costs

### OpenAI API (Primary Cost Driver)
**Model:** gpt-3.5-turbo (optimized for speed)
- Input tokens: $0.0015 per 1K tokens
- Output tokens: $0.002 per 1K tokens

**Typical Meal Plan Generation:**
- Input: ~800 tokens (prompt + user preferences)
- Output: ~1,200 tokens (7-day meal plan JSON)
- Cost per generation: ~$0.0036

### Other API Costs
**YouTube Data API v3:** Free tier (10,000 requests/day)
**Spoonacular API:** $0.004 per request (recipe data)
**USDA FoodData API:** Free
**Instacart API:** Free tier available

## Usage Scenarios & Cost Per User

### Light User (5 meal plans/month)
- OpenAI: 5 × $0.0036 = $0.018
- Spoonacular: 5 × $0.004 = $0.020
- **Total: ~$0.04/month**

### Regular User (20 meal plans/month)
- OpenAI: 20 × $0.0036 = $0.072
- Spoonacular: 20 × $0.004 = $0.080
- **Total: ~$0.15/month**

### Heavy User (50 meal plans/month)
- OpenAI: 50 × $0.0036 = $0.18
- Spoonacular: 50 × $0.004 = $0.20
- **Total: ~$0.38/month**

## Current Infrastructure Capacity

### Replit Hosting
- **Autoscale deployment** handles traffic spikes
- **PostgreSQL database** with connection pooling
- **CDN** for static assets

### Rate Limits
- OpenAI: 3,500 requests/minute (paid tier)
- YouTube API: 10,000/day (free tier)
- Spoonacular: Based on plan (starts at 150/day free)

## Scalability Projections

### 100 Users
- Average cost: $15/month (assuming mix of usage levels)
- Infrastructure: Current Replit setup sufficient
- Database: <1GB storage needed

### 1,000 Users  
- Average cost: $150/month
- Infrastructure: May need dedicated database
- Optimization: Implement caching for repeated meal plans

### 10,000 Users
- Average cost: $1,500/month
- Infrastructure: Microservices architecture needed
- Optimization: Batch processing, advanced caching

## Cost Optimization Strategies

### Immediate (Current Scale)
1. **Caching popular meal plans** - reduce API calls by 30%
2. **Smart prompt optimization** - reduce token usage by 20%
3. **Batch nutrition calculations** - reduce USDA API calls

### Medium Scale (1K+ users)
1. **Redis caching layer** for frequent requests
2. **Database meal plan templates** to reduce AI generations
3. **CDN for recipe images** and static content

### Large Scale (10K+ users)  
1. **Custom meal planning algorithm** for common requests
2. **Regional API servers** to reduce latency
3. **User subscription tiers** to manage heavy usage

## Revenue Model Recommendations

### Freemium Approach
- **Free Tier:** 5 meal plans/month ($0.04 cost)
- **Pro Tier ($4.99/month):** Unlimited plans + premium features
- **Family Tier ($9.99/month):** Multiple users + meal prep features

### Break-even Analysis
- Free users: Covered by Pro subscribers (125:1 ratio)
- Pro users: 1,000% markup covers infrastructure + development
- Target: 20% conversion rate from free to paid

## Risk Factors & Mitigation

### API Cost Spikes
- **Risk:** Viral growth causing unexpected costs
- **Mitigation:** Rate limiting, usage alerts, emergency caps

### Third-party Dependencies
- **Risk:** YouTube/Spoonacular pricing changes
- **Mitigation:** Multiple provider strategy, fallback systems

### Infrastructure Scaling
- **Risk:** Traffic exceeding Replit capacity  
- **Mitigation:** Auto-scaling alerts, migration plan to AWS/GCP

## Current Recommendations

1. **Implement usage tracking** to monitor per-user costs
2. **Add rate limiting** to prevent abuse (10 requests/hour for free users)
3. **Create subscription system** before reaching 500 users
4. **Set up cost monitoring alerts** at $50/month threshold
